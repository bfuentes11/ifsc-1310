      <h3>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h3>
      <p>The dragon project was a very enjoyable project that I used to test my creativity and skills that I learned from the class. If I could retake the class from the beginning, I would expand my horizons more and attempt to branch out and learn more stuff on my own as we went along. While receiving feedback on my website it was brought to my attention that I should seperate the title from the background image as it would cover it up. I was also told to change the cover image as it did not really match the theme of the website. I obliged on all the requests made because it increased the visual aesthetic of the website. I also seperated the page links as to avoid people clicking on the wrong link since they were so close together.</p>
      <h3>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h3>
      <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement">Progessive Enhancement</a> is the process of seperating your content from your css and javascript in order to provide the best experience for the user and web browser. Progressive Enhancment also tries to obtain accessbility and peak functionality in all old and new browsers. Progressive Enhancement is primarily focused on the content aspect of the webpage. The entire reason web pages were ever created was for the content. The Progressive Enhancement point of view makes you start with the base of your webpage (HTML) then shifts your focus to the presentation of your HTML (CSS). Finally, it shifts your focus to the Javascript portion of your webpage. Progessive Enhancement is important to modern web technology due to the fact that content is the most important part of the web page.
